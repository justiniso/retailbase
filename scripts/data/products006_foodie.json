    "description": "Cacao husks leftover from Mast Brothers chocolate-making, steeped in Kings County moonshine â€“ talk about an awesome Brooklyn duo! The moonshine brings a subtle sweetness to the earthy bitterness and rich flavor of the cacao. The combination is amazing, and there's no added sugar, so it's not overly sweet. Plus, it comes in a super-cool glass flask.",
